# Well Done!

Time to start coding.

We need to sanitize our input text. It needs to be all lower case, and
we need to replace everything that isn't a letter ("a" to "z") with a
space.

Write the function `Similar.Ngrams.normalize/1` that does this. (I've
saved you a little time by creating the file similar/lib/ngrams.ex.)

You'll know you're done when the tests pass.
